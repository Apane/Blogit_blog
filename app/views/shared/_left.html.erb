<h1>Anthony Panepinto</h1>

<p>I'm a 22 year old entrepreneur born and raised in Toronto, Canada. I've previously worked as a private equity (PE) analyst, but have since turned to web development/programming to nurture my creative side. I have some exp in Rails, and front-end dev. So, with both a business and now technical background, I'm here to document and share my Startup journey.
